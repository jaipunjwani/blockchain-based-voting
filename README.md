# A Blockchain-based Electronic Voting System
### Description
This is a python-based electronic voting system that demonstrates how blockchain can be used to detect any changes to votes via a transparent audit trail while preserving voter anonymity. The system ensures that registered voters only receive one ballot, and that each ballot is only counted once. It simulates the decentralized nature of blockchain with a consensus process that must take place before votes are recorded.

### Requirements
Python 3, pip
### How to Run
Create a new virtual environment, and use pip to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
Then run python `main.py`
